# Understanding the latent space in Variatoinal Autoencoders
Please create a new folder named model to save models.

## Python file usage
For XX.py, type "XX.py -h" to obtain detailed usage of file.

AE.py and VAE.py are used to train Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders for text.

AE_test.py is used to evaluate Autoencoders.

test.py is used to evaluate Variational Autoencoders.

toy_test.py is specifically used to evaluate Variational Autoencoders on toy datasets.

all.py is used to determine some figures for several Variational Autoencoders at the same time.

This project uses Tensorflow 2.1.

## Dataset folder
Datasets used in this project are available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/108P6kZVGjLVzVA1JwgUOYeYoTYIo-z2p/view?usp=sharing

All datasets should be placed into the Dataset folder.
